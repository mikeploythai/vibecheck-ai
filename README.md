# Vibe Check

This is an extension for Chromium-based browsers that uses Google's Gemini Pro LLM and the YouTube Data API to assess the vibes of a YouTube video based on its comment section. Great for figuring out if the video is worth your time!

All you gotta do is activate the extension while on a video page, press the "Generate a vibe check!" button, and let Gemini assess the vibes for you.

Built using `create-vite-app` (React, TypeScript, SWC). Made for fun :)
