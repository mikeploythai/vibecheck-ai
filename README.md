This is an extension for Chromium-based browsers that uses Google's Gemini Pro LLM and the YouTube Data API to assess the vibes of a YouTube video based on its comment section. Great for quickly figuring out if the video is worth your time!

All you gotta do is activate the extension while on a video page, press the "Generate a vibe check!" button, and let Gemini assess the vibes for you.

Built using `create-vite-app` (React, TypeScript, SWC).

#### ðŸš¨ NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE

I made this for fun just to play around with an LLM and to learn how to make Chrome extensions. To use this in a production setting, the code must be refactored in order to protect the API keys from leaking to the client. Refer to the `.env.example` file for more details.
